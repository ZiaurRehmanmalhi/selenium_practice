Umair Dev,2 years ago,"Hi Ehmad, loving your videos and especially their focus on the young graduates and students currently in university because I know I didn't have much to go on while in or after uni and had to figure out on my own at the start.

Having said that, I do have a quick question that I'd love for you to answer. I think you started out as a native android dev and then got into iOS and then the web side of the spectrum. â€‹My question is, what progression path would you recommend to a native android or native iOS dev who has around 3yrs of exp. in that & has tasted a bit of node+devops as well (for operational things) while working within his team and participates in architecture and solutioning discussions.

tl;dr progression path for a native android/ios dev with 3yrs experience",https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqMa_GpbF5hYmsStUbJi2Xjz2LDggI5uAAKGew=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0
